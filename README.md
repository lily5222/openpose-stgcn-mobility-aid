# OpenPose + ST-GCN Mobility Aid Recognition

This repository implements a skeleton-based action recognition pipeline
using OpenPose and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN).

## Overview
- OpenPose for 2D keypoint extraction
- Person-level tracking
- ST-GCN for sequence-level classification
- Application: cane vs baby stroller recognition

## Dataset
The dataset is hosted externally due to size constraints.
See `data/README.md` for details.

## Status
Work in progress.
